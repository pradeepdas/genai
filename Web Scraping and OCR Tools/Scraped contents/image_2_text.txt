EXECU VE VICE PES DENT CEO
AMERICAN MEDICAL
ABSOCIATION

August 13, 2020

Ms Knstin Koegel

U.S. Department of Agriculture

Food and Nutntion Service

Center for Nutntion Policy and Promotion
1320 Braddock Plave, Room 4094
Alexandna, VA 22314

Dear Ms. Koegel

On behalf of the physician and medical student members of the Amencan Medical Association (AMAA), I
welcome the opportumty to comment on the Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Gindelines Advisory
Committee (DGAC) We commend the comnuttee for its work. We do have some recommendations that
the AMA feels will strengthen the gindelines and take into consideration the individual dietary needs
associated with certain health conditions. Food and nutrition play a crucial role in health promotion and
chrome disease prevention.

The AMA supports culturally responsive dietary and mitntional gnidelines and recogmzes that racial and
ethme disparities exist in the prevalence of obesity and diet-related diseases such as coronary heart
disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes. Dairy and meat products are promoted in federal mutrition policies
even though they are not nutnuonally required. The AMA notes that Black Amenvans are at particularly
high nsk for prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and cardiovascular mortality, and prostate and colorectal
cancers are strongly linked to dairy, processed meat, and red meat consumpnion. Such products also
contn bute to cardiovascular msk and are not nutritionally indicated for all diets. Accordingly, the AMA
recommends that the DGAC clearly indicate in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) that meat
and dairy products are optional, based on an individual's dietary needs

The AMA also asks that the DGAC provide additonal guidance for consumption of fats. The DGAC
recommended replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats, particularly polyunsaturated fats Replacing
saturated fats with unsaturated fats, particularly polyunsaturated fats, reduces the incidence of
cardiovascular disease (CVD). For ths reason, the AMA supports the recommendation, but it should
exphiitly state that people should not replace saturated fats with refined carbohydrates or sugars
Although some evidence indicates that replacing saturated fat with coniplex carbohydrates may reduce
CVD nsk, replacing saturated fats with mostly refined carbohydrates and sugars shows no change or
shehtly increased nsk for CVD

The AMA asks that the Report adopt the updated sodmm Dietary Reference Intake (DRI)
recommendations of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAASEM) 2019
report. Sodium, along with potassium, are physiologically essential nutnents: Both have also been
implicated in chrome disease nsk, particularly CVD, mainly through their effects on blood pressure
Additionally, a possible association of sodium intake with other adverse health outcomes has been

suggcsted at low levels of intake. The NASEM report uscs an expanded DRI model for limiting sodium
intake that includes consideration of chronic disease risks.

The 2020-2025 DGA should incorporate the DGAC’s recommendation that men and women who
consume alcohol should limit their intake to one drink a day on days when alcohol is consumed and that
non-drinkers should not start drinking in order to improve their health. Alcohol is a known human
carcinogen that is associated with a higher risk of cancers of the breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, liver,
mouth, pharynx, larynx, and stomach. Higher consumption increases risk but there is no safe threshold for
alcohol and cancer risk. The consumption of up to one and a half drinks per day accounts for an estimated
26 to 35 percent of all alcohol-attributable U.S. cancer deaths.

The 2020-2025 DGA should build on the 2015-2020 DGA’s policy, systems, and environmental
stratcgics to support healthy cating patterns. There are many cnvironmental and structural factors that
influence Americans’ ability to follow the DGA, including systemic disadvantages related to race and
sociocconomic status. The DGA should expand on policies addressed by DGAC and include stronger
policy recommendations for making healthy foods and beverages accessible and affordable, reduce
sodium in the food supply by releasing the short- and long-term voluntary sodium reduction targets for
industry, limit access to high-caloric, nutrient-poor foods and sugar-swectened beverages in public places,
reduce added sugars by taxing sugary drinks or other measures, and shift in-store marketing from
unhealthy to healthy options to support rather than undermine healthy cating, including through
placement, pricing, and promotion.

Thank you for considering the AMA’s comments. If you have any questions, please contact Margaret
Garikes, Vice President, Federal Affairs, at margaret. garikes@ama-assn.org or (202) 789-7409.

Sincerely,

,

James L. Madara, MD

USDA 2020 Dietary Guidelines - Ist Report

SUMMARY

The recommended USDA Food Patterns for Americans, which achieve healthy dietary
intake and meet nutritional goals and energy balance, include the Healthy U.S.-Style, the
Healthy Vegetarian, and the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Patterns. No additional food patterns
were developed during the work of this Committee, confirming the guidance on Patterns issued
from this and previous Committees (see Part D. Chapter 8: Dietary Patterns). Although these
3 Food Pattems have some key differences that allow for tailoring to individual preferences,
they share some core components, including obtaining the majority of energy from plant-based

foods, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and obtaining protein

and fats from nutrient-rich food sources, while limiting intakes of added sugars, solid fats, and

sodium,

2.4. Promoting sustainable food consumption and facilitating the
shift to healthy, sustainable diets
Current food consumption patterns are unsustainable from both health and environmental
points of view. While in the EU, average intakes of energy, red meat*’, sugars, salt and
fats continue to exceed recommendations, consumption of whole-grain cereals,
fruit and vegetables, legumes and nuts 's insufficient*

Reversing the rise in overweight and obesity rates across the EU by 2030 is
critical. Moving to a more plant-based diet with less red and processed meat
and with more fruits and vegetables will reduce not only risks of life threatening
diseases, but also the environmental impact of the food system**. It is estimated
that in the EU in 2017 over 950,000 deaths (one out of five) and over 16 million
lost healthy life years were attributable to unhealthy diets, mainly cardiovascular
diseases and cancers*®. The EU’s ‘beating cancer’ plan includes the promotion of
healthy diets as part of the actions for cancer prevention.

The provision of clear information that makes it easier for consumers to choose
healthy and sustainable diets will benefit their health and quality of life, and reduce
health-related costs. To empower consumers to make informed, healthy and
sustainable food choices, the Commission will propose harmonised mandatory front-
of-pack nutrition labelling and will consider to propose the extension of mandatory
Origin or provenance indications to certain products, while fully taking into account impacts
on the single market. The Commission will also examine ways to harmonise voluntary green
claims and to create a sustainable labelling framework that covers, in synergy with other relevant
initiatives, the nutritional, climate, environmental and social aspects of food products. The Commission
will also explore new ways to provide information to consumers through other means including digital, to
improve the accessibility of food information in particular for visually impaired persons.

Create a nutrition plan that
works for you. Ask your doctor
to help you create a diet that

best fits your needs
and preferences.

While historically an American meal has been dominated by large
portions of meat with smaller portions of vegetables, the AICR
suggests this revised approach:

Make a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans the
center of most meals

Favor an unprocessed, plant-based diet over meat and other
animal-based foods

— When eating meat, choose unprocessed lean cuts, keep your
portions small, and increase your portions of whole grains
and vegetables

Replace starches with whole grains like brown rice, barley, bulgur,
and quinoa

Try combining smaller portions of meat with larger portions of fresh
vegetables and whole grains into one-pot meals like stir-fries that
you Can serve in a bowl

phytochemicals that help keep you in good health, and protect against cancer. They are

VEGAN POEM BY ONE

CLASSICAL

ARABIC POETS

VEGAN | PHILOSOPMER | POET | WRITER

Do not unjustly eat fish the water has given up,

And do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals,

Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draught

for thelr young, not nobie ladies.

And do not grieve the unsuspecting birds by taking eggs;

for injustice ts the worst of crimes.

And spare the honey which the bees get industriously

from the flowers of fragrant plants;

For they did not store it that It might belong to others,

Nor did they gather it for bounty and gifts. %

To the EOC, Lenten is atestof “During the lent fasting most of the EOC is considered as

> THE CASE before after

A 44-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity reestablished care in our clinic. He had
been treated in our health care system about 5 years previously, and prior lab testing showed
a total cholesterol of 203 mg/dL; triglycerides, 191 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein (HDL),
56 mg/dL; and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), 109 mg/dL. At that time, he weighed 299 Ibs
(BMI, 39.4). He then started a strict ketogenic diet and a regular exercise program (running
~ 16 miles per week and lifting weights), which he maintained for several years. He had ex-
perienced remarkable weight loss; upon reestablishing care, he weighed 199 Ibs (BMI, 26.33).

However, lipid testing revealed a severely elevated total cholesterol of 334 mg/dL; LDL,
248 mg/dL; HDL, 67 mg/dL; and triglycerides, 95 mg/dL. He was advised to start statin therapy
and to stop his ketogenic diet, but he was hesitant to take either step. He elected to have his
lab work reevaluated in 6 months. -

About 4 months later, he presented with new and increasing burning pain in his mid
chest and upper abdomen. He rated the pain 6/10 in severity and said it occurred during ex-
ertion or at night when lying down. Resting would relieve the pain. Reduced intake of spicy
foods and caffeine had also helped. He denied dyspnea, diaphoresis, palpitations, or nausea.

The patient was a nonsmoker but did have a strong family history of cardiovascular dis-
ease. His vital signs and physical examination were unremarkable, apart from mild epigastric
and periumbilical tenderness on palpation.

!! Low Carb & Keto Diets !!

8 Low-carb vs low-fat. Multiple meta-
analyses comparing low-carb diets to low-fat
diets have found that those following low-
carb diets have significantly higher total cho-
lesterol and LDL levels.*** The National Lipid
Association's review of evidence determined
that LDL and total cholesterol responses vary
in individuals following a low-carb diet, but
that increasing LDL levels in particular were
concerning enough to warrant lipid monitor-
ing of patients on low-carb diets.* Another
meta-analysis evaluated the difference in
estimated atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease (ASCVD) risk between low-carb and
low-fat diets, finding those following a low-
carb diet to have a lower estimated ASCVD
risk but higher LDL levels.’

§ Weighing the benefits and harms.
Since our patient's dramatic weight loss and

terol of 153 mg/dL; LDL, 53 mg/dL; HDL,
89 mg/dL; and triglycerides, 55 mg/dL. He
had also switched to a regular diet and had
been able to maintain his weight loss.

THE TAKEAWAY

Growing evidence suggests that low-carb di-
ets may have a significant and detrimental
effect on LDL levels. The long-term safety of
these diets hasn’t been well studied, particu-
larly regarding cardiovascular outcomes. At
a minimum, patients who initiate low-carb
diets should be counseled on general dietary
recommendations regarding saturated fat
and cholesterol intake, and they should have
a follow-up lipid screening to evaluate for any
significant worsening in total cholesterol and
LDL levels. JFP

Adventist Health Studies: An Overview

dventist Health Studies are long-term health studies exploring the links between lifestyle, diet
and disease among members of the Seventh-day Adventist church, a Christian denomination that
encourages a vegetarian diet and calls for abstinence from alcohol and tobacco. Adventists are ideal
for epidemiological studies in that their similarity in lifestyle behaviors (such as not smoking) reduces
the likelihood of confounding that is often present in other study groups. To date there have been five
Adventist Health Studies, based out of Loma Linda University. Key results are highlighted below.

Adventist Mortality Study: 1958-1966
23,000 California Adventists ages 25+
Conducted at the same time as the American
Cancer Society study of non-Adventists.
Comparisons were made for many causes of
death between the two populations.

Key Results:

e The risk of coronary heart disease (CHD)
was significantly lower in vegetarian
compared to non-vegetarian Adventists.

e All-cause mortality showed a significant
positive association with egg intake and a
negative association with consumption of
green salads.

e Compared to other Californians, Adventists
experienced lower rates of death for: all
cancers (60% [of non-Adventist rates] for
Adventist men, 75% for Adventist women);
lung cancer (21%); colorectal cancer (62%);
breast cancer (85%); CHD (66% for Adventist
men, 98% for Adventist women).

Adventist Health Study-1: 1974-1988
34,192 California Adventists ages 25+
Investigated factors relating to the incidence
of disease and mainly compared the different
health habits, especially differences in diet, of
Adventists.

Key Results:

e Vegetarians had a lower risk of obesity,
hypertension, diabetes and death from all
Causes.

e In men, the risk of fatal heart disease was
significantly related to beef intake.

e Regular nut and whole grain consumption
were associated with a lower risk of CHD.
e The risk of colon cancer was increased

by 88% in non-vegetarian compared to
vegetarian Adventists. Consumption of
legumes (beans) had a protective effect
against colon cancer.

e On average, Adventist men live 7.3 years
longer and Adventist women live 4.4 years
longer than other Californians.

e Men with a high consumption of tomatoes
had a 40% lower risk of prostate cancer.

Adventist Health Air Pollution Study: 1976-Present

6,328 California Adventists ages 25+

A sub-study of Adventist Health Study-1, funded by the Environmental
Protection Agency. Its goal is to link the effects of various indoor and
outdoor pollutants with respiratory diseases and lung cancer.

Adventist Health Study-2: 2002-Present

96,000 U.S. and Canadian Adventists ages 30+

One of the largest and most comprehensive studies of diet and
cancer in the world. Also one of the largest studies of Black/African
Americans, with 26,000 Black participants.

Preliminary Key Results:

e Data show a progressive weight increase from a total vegetarian
diet toward a non-vegetarian diet. For instance, 55-year-old male and
female vegans weigh about 30 pounds less than non-vegetarians of
similar height.

e Levels of cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, and the
metabolic syndrome all had the same trend - the closer to being a
vegetarian, the lower the risk in these areas. True for Black as well as
non-Black participants.

¢ High consumption of cooked green vegetables, brown rice,
legumes and dried fruit was linked to a decreased risk of colon
polyps, a precursor to colon cancer.

e A vegetarian diet was not associated with lower levels of vitamin
D. Other factors, such as amount and intensity of sun exposure, had
a greater influence on vitamin D levels in blood than diet.

Adventist Religion and Health Study: 2006-Present

11,000 U.S. and Canadian Adventists ages 30+

A sub-study of Adventist Health Study-2 examining which aspects of
religion account for better or worse health, as well as tracing some
of the biopsychosocial pathways to health.

Preliminary Key Results:

e Black and non-Black Adventists reported better physical and mental
quality of life than the U.S. norm. The advantage for mental quality of
life is greater in older age groups.

e Individuals who experienced childhood poverty are more religious.
However, childhood poverty also relates to more abusive and
conflicted families in childhood, particularly in non-black participants.
Those who experienced an abusive home as a child are less likely to
be religious.

¢ Not surprisingly, divorced individuals had more depressive
symptoms than non-divorced individuals, but divorced individuals
who used positive religious coping had fewer depressive symptoms
than those who did not use positive religious Coping.

JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF MEDICINE Volume 90 January 1997

Coronary heart disease: outlook for Africa

AR P Walker OSc_ P Sareli MD'

JR Soc Med 1997 :90:23-27

SUMMARY

in Africa, coronary heart disease (CHD) is near absent in rural areas, and very uncommon in urban centres, where
many Africans are in an advanced stage of transition. Among town dwellers intakes of food, especially fat, have risen
and intakes of fibre-containing foods have fallen. Mean serum cholesterol level is almost double that of rural
populations living traditionally. Obesity in females has risen enormously. Prevalence of hypertension exceeds that in
the white population. The same appiles to the practice of smoking in males, but not in females. The level of physical
activity has fallen generally. With these increases in risk factors we can expect urban Africans to attain the high
mortality rate for CHD now experienced by Afro-Americans. Prevention by urging reversion to previous life-style

behaviour is a non-starter. However, as long as Africa remains impoverished, a major rise in CHD is unlikely.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Numerous reviews have emphasized the rarity of coronary
heart disease (CHD) in Africa. In 1960, Shaper and
Williams' considered CHD to be ‘extremely rare’ in
Uganda. In 1977, Vaughan described Africans as ‘virtually
free of hypertension and CHD”. In the same year, at Enugu,
Nigeria, not one patient out of 348 with cardiac disorders,
over a 4-year period, had CHD?. In 1983, in the UK, a
leading article on ‘British and African Hearts’ underlined the
tremendous contrast between the experience of CHD in
the two types of population*. Later, in Zimbabwe, at the
Parirenyatwa Hospital, which is the main referral centre for
the country, from 1988 to 1993 there was an annual average
of six African patients with acute myocardial infarction’.
Even at present, as concluded in a comprehensive review by
Bertrand, compiled in Nigeria, ‘CHD is still rare . . . de-
spite its increased incidence in recent years’. This rarity
applies particularly to rural dwellers, as recently noted also
in Tanzania’.

In Johannesburg in 1946 Becker found only one death
due to the disease from post-mortems made on a series of
352 Africans aged 50 years and over®. Subsequent studies
undertaken in the same city by Higginson and Pepler? in
1954, and by Reef and Isaacson! in 1962, testified to the
rarity of occlusion of the coronary arteries. In Durban in

Human Biochemistry Research Unit, Department of Tropical Diseases, Schoo! of
Pathology of the University of the Witwatersrand, and the South African institute
for Medical Research, Johannesburg, South Africa; ‘Department of Cardiology,
Baragwanath Hospital and the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg,
South Africa

Correspondence to: Dr A R P Walker, South African institute for Medical
Research, PO Box 1038, Johannesburg, South Africa

1976, Seedat et al. emphasized that myocardial infarction
was rare in Africans; about 10 cases were seen annually at
King Edward VIII Hospital out of a catchment population
stated to be about 2 million''. Chesler et al., also in Durban,
concluded that ‘prevalence of the disease has not increased
over the last two decades and the immunity of the African
population is unexplained’'?. Later, in 1980, from their
angiographic and other studies carried out in the same city,
Thandroyen et al. reaffirmed that ‘coronary heart disease is
rare in the black population’!>. In 1992, Seedat et al. noted
rises in risk factors, yet CHD remained very uncommon's.

In Soweto (which has an approximate population of 3
million or more, and is adjacent to Johannesburg), at
Baragwanath Hospital (3200 beds), according to records of
the department of cardiology, in 1992, 35 Africans were
diagnosed with CHD; in 1993, 51; but in 1994, 62 patients.
However, of the latter number, 36 were Sowetans; the rest
lived elsewhere. Thus, CHD remains very uncommon in
urban Africans in South Africa.

To afford perspective—how uncommon is CHD in
Africans, when compared with its occurrence in western
populations? The main part of the population in Soweto
attend Baragwanath Hospital. If it is assumed that all of the
36 CHD patients mentioned ultimately die from the disease,
then CHD would be responsible for only about 0.2% of the
roughly 20000 deaths occurring annually in Soweto!’, an
extremely low proportion even allowing for uncertainties. In
the recently reported Seven Countries Study'®, for those in
the Mediterranean countries and inland the age standardized
25 year CHD mortality rate percentages were 4.7% and
7.7% respectively. The proportions reported for countries in
Northern Europe and for the US were far higher, namely

GRAIN PARTS
THE ENDOSPERM

The endosperm is the germ’s food

supply, which provides essential energy

to the young plant so it can send roots
down for water and nutrients, and send
sprouts up for sunlight’s photosynthesizing
power. The endosperm is by far the largest
portion of the kernel. It contains starchy
carbohydrates, proteins and small amounts
of vitamins and minerals.

THE BRAN

The bran is the multi-layered
outer skin of the edible kernel. It
contains important antioxidants,

B vitamins, and fiber.

THE GERM

The germ is the embryo which has the
potential to sprout into a new plant. It
contains many B vitamins, some protein,
minerals, and healthy fats.

Note that words like “wheat,” “durum,” and “multigrain” can (and do) appear on good whole grain
foods, too. None of these words alone guarantees whether a product is whole grain or refined
grain, so look for the word “whole” and follow the other advice here.

INTRODUCE BEANS AND
LENTILS GRADUALLY.
START WITH SMALLER
LENTILS FIRST

When introducing legumes it’s
best to take it slow so your gut
bacteria can adjust to the increase
in dietary fibre. Start with a
tablespoon at a time and build up
the amount over the course of a
few months.

EVERYBODY FARTS - IT’S A NORMAL BODILY FUNCTION
We need to normalise gas. However, if digestive issues interfere
\ with your quality of life, please seek medical advice.


Text from C:\Users\aiman\Documents\thankful2plants\Articles\Articles\article_400\image_2.jpg:
RINSE CANNED BEANS
AND LENTILS

Ensure you thoroughly drain

and rinse legumes to remove

the water containing indigestible
carbohydrates (aquafaba).

This can lead to gas-induced
discomfort. As canned beans can
also be high in sodium, the rinsing
method can help remove excess
sodium. Choose canned beans
with no salt added if possible.



Text from C:\Users\aiman\Documents\thankful2plants\Articles\Articles\article_400\image_3.jpg:
SOAK BEANS AND LENTILS
OVERNIGHT AND SPROUT
BEFORE COOKING THEM
Soaking beans and lentils from scratch
is healthier, saves money and can
potentially reduce bloating too. Soak
beans and lentils for 6 -10 hours in
room temperature water to reduce
cooking time. Ensure you discard the
soaking water. Sprouting legumes
before cooking them is a wonderful
way to increase nutrient absorption
(including protein digestibility).

COOK BEANS AND
LENTILS UNTIL SOFT -

Undercooking beans and lentils

- will nof break down the léctins

present and could lead to you

feeling unwell. Cook them until
they're so soft you could easily

EAT MINDFULLY AND
CHEW EACH MOUTHFUL
THOROUGHLY

Digestion starts in the mouth.
Sit down and try.foreat slowly
without distractions such as
phones and television screens.
Enjoy the experience of eating
and take a moment to savour
the textures and flavours of your
meal.


Text from C:\Users\aiman\Documents\thankful2plants\Articles\Articles\article_400\image_6.jpg:
ENJOY HERBS & SPICES

Most herbs and spices contain a
variety of antioxidants, flavonoids,
and other beneficial phytonufrients.
Cumin seeds or ground cumin helps
with digestion and is perfect in a
soup, curry or dal (lentil dish). Carom
seeds, fennel seeds, turmeric and
peppermint are other great digestive
aids. Cooking beans with a large strip
of dried kombu, a Japanese dried
kelp, may minimise their gas-producing
properties too.

TRY ASAFOETIDA

This strong-smelling spice, often
known as “hing”, offers relief from
stomach gas. Add a small pinch to
dal or khichadi - a rice and lentil
dish. Asafoetida is also a great
low FODMAP alternative to onion
and garlic. Asafoetida should be
avoided in pregnancy (or if you
are trying to get pregnant) as it
may induce nausea and vomiting,
especially if one is not used fo if.

GRATE GINGER

Ginger soothes the muscles of

the digestive tract and has anti-
inflammatory properties. Grate

1 tablespoon into your bean and
lentil dishes. You could also try
sipping on a fresh ginger tea after
eating a fibre-rich meal.

DRINK ENOUGH WATER AS
YOU INCREASE THE FIBRE IN
YOUR DIET

As fibre draws water into the bowel,
you could get dehydrated if you aren’t
drinking enough fluid. Staying hydrated
helps fibre to do its job and prevents
constipation. Try caffeine-tree herbal teas
for variety. Sugar-sweetened beverages
such as fizzy drinks or caffeinated
beverages can make digestive issues
worse for some people.

To) -TaloRal-y-]h98

More and more people in the US are becoming familiar with soy-based foods like tofu,
tempeh, miso, edamame, and soy milk. These foods are common in plant-based diets, and
there is alot of confusion about their health properties.

Much of the confusion relates to phytoestrogens: these are estrogen-like compounds that
occur naturally in some plants. The most common phytoestrogens are isoflavones in soy
and lignans in seeds. These compounds preferentially bind to estrogen receptors in the

body, which means they can have a mild estrogen effect.

You might have heard the common false claim that soy causes an increased risk of breast
cancer. But this has since been disproven by studies.

So, what’s the truth about soy?

Soy does NOT cause breast cancer

Early research on breast cancer showed a4 correlation
between hormone replacement therapy (medications
containing estrogen and progesterone) and an increased
risk of breast cancer. Because of this, researchers falsely
assumed that phytoestrogen-containing foods like soy
would also increase breast cancer risk. But this has since
been disproven by many studies.

High soy intake is actually linked to a REDUCED risk of breast
cancer and other cancers
When phytoestrogens preferentially bind to our body's

estrogen receptors, they can kick estrogen out of its binding
site. This substitution results in a generally weaker estrogen
effect in the body, which may be significant in preventing
estrogen-sensitive breast cancers.

to reduced breast cancer recurrence

Studies have suggested that a diet high in isoflavones is
linked to reduced breast cancer recurrence, thus suggesting
that soy consumption is okay even in people who have
previously been diagnosed with breast cancer.

Increased soy intake may be linked to improved bone health
some studies suggest that a diet high in soy promotes

improved bone health and a reduced risk of osteoporosis.

Not all soy products are equal
Highly processed soy-based products-plant-based meats

and packaged foods, for example—do not provide the same
health benefits and may even be harmful. Processed
products generally contain high amounts of fat plus
chemicals and fillers with potentially negative health effects.
Products with “isolated soy protein” or “soy protein isolate”
listed in the ingredients are usually highly processed and
should generally be avoided.

FIVE WAYS 10 AVOID COLDS AND FLU

Here are effective foods to eat that can help boost your immune system and
reduce your vulnerability to infection.

Mushrooms

Eat cooked mushrooms
to enhance the activity
of the body’s natural
killer (NK) cells, which
attack virus-infected
cells. Mushrooms also
boost immune defenses
in the mouth and respira-
tory tract. | recommend
taking a mixed
mushroom supplement.

Vegetables

Kale, collards, mustard
greens, arugula,

> watercress, broccoli,

broccoli rabe, cabbage,

> cauliflower, and kohlrabi
> contain glucosinolates,

- which are converted

: into immune- boosting

- isothyocyanates (ITCs)

> when chopped or

- chewed. Eat some raw

cruciferous every day.

Berries

Rich in vitamin C

and antioxidants

like flavonoids and
resveratrol, berries offer
antiviral protection and
can block the replication
of flu and other
respiratory viruses.
Drinking elderberry

> juice may shorten

the duration of
flu symptoms.

Vr Fuhrman

Onions & Garlic

- The allium family has

anti-cancer and immune-
boosting benefits. Garlic

- contains phytochemicals
- with powerful virus-kill-
- ing benefits. The active

compounds in these

- vegetables are activated

when chopped or

- chewed raw. Add onions,

scallions, or shallots to

- your salad every day.

Add a few spoonfuls of

- chopped raw onion to

your cooked vegetables.

Supplements

Taking a supplement
that includes vitamin D,
zinc, iodine, and B12 will
help reduce the risk of
infection and improve
recovery from colds and
flu. Zinc absorption is
hindered by phytates in
plant foods, so vegans
need a bit more to
Maximize immunity.

It is also important

to assure Vitamin D
adequacy for optimal
immune function.

Basis FoR RECOMMENDATIONS

There are no known risks of chronic disease associated with consuming diets
very low in saturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids, or cholesterol. Since certain
micronutnents are found mainly in animal foods (which are typically high in

saturated fats and cholesterol), wis possible that diets low in saturated fat and
cholesterol may contain low levels of micronutnents, such as iron and zinc
Furthermore, analysis of nutntionally adequate menus indicates that there is a
minimum amount of saturated fat that can be consumed so that adequate levels
of linoleic and a-linolentc acids are provided

A substantial body of evidence suggests that saturated fatty acids, trans
fatty acids, and cholesterol raise blood total and LDL cholesterol levels, which
in turn increases risk of CHD. Because there is a positive linear trend between
intake of each of these fats and risk of CHD, even very low intakes of each may
increase risk. It is thus recommended that intakes of saturated fatty acids, trans
fatty acids, and cholesterol remain as low as possible while a nutntionally ad
equate diet is consumed

and dietary cholesterol consumption to be as low

as possible without compromising the nutritional
adequacy of the diet. The USDA Dietary Patterns are
limited in trans fats and low in dietary cholesterol.
Cholesterol and a small amount of trans fat occur
naturally in some animal source foods. As of June
2018, partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs), the major
source of artificial trans fat in the food supply, are no

PLANT BASED DAIRY ANALOGUES ARE BETTER THAN DAIRY
MILK FOR YOUR HEALTH, THE ENVIRONMENT AND ANIMALS.
PRESENTING THE FACTS THAT WILL BUST THE MYTHS.

MYTH FACT

1. DAIRY FARMING IS GOOD FOR THE
CATTLE

2. MILK IS A COMPLETE FOOD,
NATURAL AS WELL AS
VEGETARIAN. IT IS A SUPERFOOD

3. MILK IS THE DAIRY INDUSTRY.
IMPERSONATING OR
MASQUERADING AS DAIRY
PRODUCT IS ILLEGAL

4. MILK IS AN INSTRUMENT OF
SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT &
DAIRY IS INDIA'S LARGEST CROP
CONTRIBUTING RS 8 LAC CRORE TO
THE GDP

MILK.
MORE THAN ONE.
CHOOSE THE BETTER ONE.

https://sharan-india.org/dairy_meat_alternatives/

1. DAIRY IS CRUEL TO CATTLE

A mother cow produces milk only after she delivers, to feed her baby
calf. The milk supply is according to her boby’s needs. In dairy farming,
cows are artificially inseminated so that they will produce mik when
they give birth. The female calves get the last drops of milk. The males
are either starved or go to slaughter for their meat and skin. Milk is
extracted with machines, which can be extremely painful. Cows are re-
impregnated within 5 months of delivery and injected with hormones
(oxytocin) to produce more mik. Within 2-5 cycles cows are spent and
sent to sloughter. India is the largest exporter of beef in the world. How
ts this good for cattle?

2. COW'S MILK CAUSES DISEASE

Each mammal species produces milk specific to the needs of its baby
and not for any other species. Dairy milk is a complete food for the calf
but neither a complete nor a natural food for us.

Although dairy has been considered vegetarian it does not come from a
plant, and animals ore killed for its production. Therefore it is not really
vegetarian.

We can get enough proteins, calcium and minerals from the same place
thot cows get them - plonts. But milk lacks one important ingredient for
human health that all plants have - fibre.

Cow's milk is far from a superfood for humans because it’s high in fat
and cholesterol, and is full of hormones. It can couse hormonal issues
such as premature puberty, hypothyroidism, PCOO, diabetes, prostate
enlargement, obesity, infertility and can promote breast, prostate and
ovarion cancers.

Plant-based milks made at home ore far less expensive than cow's milk,
but the real savings come in the form of health.

3. THE WORD ‘MILK’ HAS ALWAYS BEEN USED
FOR SUBSTANCES BEYOND DAIRY

The word milk has been used since ages for non-dairy substances like
coconut mik and milk of magnesia. It’s just a word. Every plant-based
milk brand clearty lists its ingredients. Why is this even being
considered as illegal?

4. THE PRODUCTION OF DAIRY MILK CAUSES
LONG TERM DEFICITS

Milk production may be good for the former but it’s cousing national
deficits. India has the largest number of cattle in the world and all
these animals need to eat and drink and have space. We don’t have
enough food to feed our billions, yet we produce food to feed cows in
order to produce milk? Eating higher on the food chain implies a huge
loss in productivity.

It’s scientifically proven that fruit trees yield the maximum food per
acre of land and water consumption. Fruits require no plastic
packaging and are totally ecological.

Our country has water shortages and all these animals require water.
And cutting forests for grazing grounds is robbing India of both trees
and biodiversity. It causes climate change. Should we rob our country
of its future? You don’t need any milk since you are not an infant but
with plant-based milks cause less ecological damage. You hove a
choice. Try it.

“Smoothies offer a convenient
way to boost both the quantity
and quality of fruit and
vegetable intake by reducing
food particle size to help
maximize nutrient absorption.”



Text from C:\Users\aiman\Documents\thankful2plants\Articles\Articles\article_686\image_2.jpg:
The texture of smoothies may not only boost the
quantity of fruit and vegetable consumption, but
also the quality. Carotenoid phytonutrients, like
beta carotene and lycopene, can exist as
microscopic crystals trapped within the cell walls of
fruits and vegetables, and are released only when
the cells are disrupted. That’s why chewing
thoroughly is so important. We can never chew as
well as a blender, though. In terms of digestive
efficiency and nutrient absorption, chewing is good,
but blending is better. It’s not what you eat, but
what you absorb.



Text from C:\Users\aiman\Documents\thankful2plants\Articles\Articles\article_686\image_3.jpg:
Why does this matter? Take folate, for example, the B
vitamin in greens that is especially important for
women of childbearing age. When you feed people a
daily cup of spinach for three weeks, their folate goes
up, compared to control. What if you finely chop it with
a knife before chewing it? You end up with more than
twice as much folate in your bloodstream. You also get
the same absorption-boosting effect with lutein, the
green nutrient so important for our eyesight.



Text from C:\Users\aiman\Documents\thankful2plants\Articles\Articles\article_686\image_4.jpg:
It’s important to use whole fruits and veggies rather
than just their juices. When we juice, we lose the
fiber and all the phytonutrients bound to it.



Text from C:\Users\aiman\Documents\thankful2plants\Articles\Articles\article_686\image_5.jpg:
Slow and steady, or race to the finish? We can drink
fruits and vegetables in smoothie form at about two
cups per minute, which is ten times faster than what
it may take to eat them in solid form. Since liquid
calories can be consumed so quickly, they can
undermine our body’s capacity to regulate food intake,
so sip smoothies slowly rather than gulping them down
to allow our brain and body to be in sync as to how full
we are. To slow down even more, try a smoothie bowl,
a thicker smoothie you can eat with a spoon.



Text from C:\Users\aiman\Documents\thankful2plants\Articles\Articles\article_686\image_6.jpg:
Did you know that a smoothie with lemon or other
acidic fruits or vegetables may temporarily soften
the enamel on your teeth? You don’t have to avoid
sour smoothies, though. Just be sure to drink it
through a reusable straw, avoid swishing the smoothie
in your mouth, and rinse your mouth with water
afterwards to help reduce tooth enamel erosion.

Nutella is more akin to milk chocolate with hazelnuts for fat. sugar and kilcycules.
they re so close See my compariscn cf the two weight for weight: Nutella side by

There are no known risks of chronic disease associated with consuming diets
very low in saturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids, or cholesterol. Since certain
micronutnents are found mainly in animal foods (which are typically high in

saturated fats and cholesterol), wis possible that diets low in saturated fat and
cholesterol may contain low levels of micronutnents, such as iron and zinc
Furthermore, analysis of nutntionally adequate menus indicates that there is a
minimum amount of saturated fat that can be consumed so that adequate levels
of linoleic and a-linolentc acids are provided

A substantial body of evidence suggests that saturated fatty acids, trans
fatty acids, and cholesterol raise blood total and LDL cholesterol levels, which
in turn increases risk of CHD. Because there is a positive linear trend between
intake of each of these fats and risk of CHD, even very low intakes of each may
increase risk. It is thus recommended that intakes of saturated fatty acids, trans
fatty acids, and cholesterol remain as low as possible while a nutntionally ad

percent of total calories. For someone eating 2,000

USDA Guidelines for Saturated Fats (2015-2020)

Saturated Fats

Healthy intake: Intake of saturated fats should be limited to less than 10 percent of
calories per day by replacing them with unsaturated fats and while keeping tota
dietary fats within the age-appropriate AMDR. The human body uses some
saturated fats for physiological and structural functions, but it makes more than
enough to meet those needs. Individuals 2 years and older therefore have no
dietary requirement for saturated fats.


Text from C:\Users\aiman\Documents\thankful2plants\Articles\Articles\article_717\image_6.jpg:
WHO (World Health Organization) — Healthy Diet for Adults

‘Fruit, vegetables, legumes ¢e.. tentiis and beans), NUtS and
whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and brown rice).

- At least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of fruit and vegetables per day (2), excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes,
cassava and other starchy roots.

- Less than 10% of total energy intake from free sugars (2, 7), which is
equivalent to 50 g (or about 12 level teaspoons) for a person of healthy body weight consuming about 2000
calories per day, but ideally is less than 5% of total energy intake for additional health benefits (7). Free
sugars are all sugars added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, as well as sugars
naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates.

- Less than 30% of total energy intake from fats (1, 2, 3). Unsaturated fats
(found in fish, avocado and nuts, and in sunflower, soybean, canola and olive oils) are preferable to saturated
fats (found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard) and trans-fats of all
kinds, including both industrially-produced trans-fats (found in baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged
snacks and foods, such as frozen pizza, pies, cookies, biscuits, wafers, and cooking oils and spreads) and
ruminant trans-fats (found in meat and dairv foods from ruminant animals. such as cows. sheep. goats and

camels). It is suggested that the INtake Of Saturated fats be reduced to less
than 10% of total energy intake and trans-fats to less than 1% of

total energy intake (5). In particular, industrially-produced trans-fats are not part of a healthy
diet and should be avoided (4, 6).

‘Less than 5 g of salt (equivalent to about one teaspoon) per day (8). Salt should
be iodized.

The Rationale: FAT
No more than 10% total calories from fat

The rationale for the Nutrition Spectrum Reversal Program guidelines can be stated briefly: 10% OF
TOTAL CALORIES FROM FAT. The guideline of 10% of calories from fat provides sufficient nutrition,
supports heart disease regression and weight loss. It can be accomplished by eating a wide range of
satisfying and pleasurable foods.

Limiting dietary fat to 10% of total calories reduces consumption of all fats, which decreases blood
cholesterol levels. It also typically reduces total calorie intake, because fat contains 9 calories per
gram compared to 4 calories per gram in carbohydrates and protein. Reducing body weight reduces
risk because obesity adds to the risk of heart disease.

A nutrition program without added fats and high-fat foods (i.e. meat, fish, poultry, milk fat, oils and
high-fat plant foods) still contains about 10% of calories from fat. This comes from the naturally-
occurring fat in grain products and some vegetables and beans. Excessive food restrictions would be
required for the nutrition program to go lower than 10% fat. The human body needs about 5% of
calories from fat to obtain the essential fats for good health. Plus, there are no research studies that
have evaluated or supported a fat intake below 10% fat.

Diets with higher amounts of fat (20-30% fat) have not been associated with heart disease reversal. In
addition, high-fat diets have been associated with increased risk of Some cancers, such as breast,
colon and prostate.

About Dietary Fat

All fats and oils contain three kinds of fat: saturated fat, monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat.
These kinds of fats are present in different proportions in fats and oils, and they affect blood
cholesterol level differently. Typically, foods that are very high in saturated fat are solid at room
temperature, and foods that are very low in saturated fat are liquid at room temperature.

SATURATED FAT:

e Increases blood cholesterol (it is changed in the liver into cholesterol).

e ls an independent risk factor for heart diseases (It increases risk of heart disease even if blood
cholesterol and blood pressure don't rise significantly.)

e Contributes to weight gain and obesity.
e ls found in highest proportions in animal fat and hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils.

e ls contained in some plant foods (avocados, olives, coconut, nuts, seeds and cocoa products
like chocolate).

MONOUNSATURATED FAT:

e Does not raise blood cholesterol.

e Does not appear to increase risk for cancer.
e Contributes to weight gain and obesity.
e ls found in highest proportions in olive oil and canola oil.

e Is not 100% of any oil (even oils high in monounsaturated fat like olive oil and canola oil
contain some saturated fat polyunsaturated fat)?

POLYUNSATURATED FAT:

e Lowers “good” HDL-cholesterol, therefore increasing risk of heart disease.
e Increases risk of cancer.

e ls found in highest proportions in vegetable oils (unhydrogenated) such as corn oil and
safflower oils.

About Blood Fats

The blood has several components that are thought to be meaningful in predicting heart disease.

e LDL-cholesterol (which stands for low-density lipoprotein) is called the “bad” cholesterol
because it increases risk of heart disease.

e HDL-cholesterol (which stands for high-density lipoprotein) called the “good” cholesterol
because it removes LDL cholesterol from the blood.

e Triglycerides are the yellow fat globules that appear in the blood after eating a high-fat meal.

You've likely heard that it is good to have low LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels and high HDL-
cholesterol levels. The studies that led to these conclusions were based on people who ate typical
high-fat American meals. These conclusions may not be true for vegetarians. Vegetarians tend to
have low total cholesterol levels, low HDL, LDL and triglyceride levels and low rates of heart disease.

On the Dr. Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease, HDL-cholesterol levels stay the same

or go down slightly. This is not a concern because when total cholesterol and saturated fat intakes are
low, the body makes less HDL because it does not need it. Triglyceride levels may increase on the Dr.
Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease. |n most cases, this may not be important because

The type of triglyceride that increases is the "fluffy" kind, which is not thought to be related to heart
disease risk. However, high triglyceride levels are being recognized as a risk factor for heart disease,
and therefore, it is advisable to keep levels as low as possible. This can be achieved by avoiding
simple carbohydrates and overly refined foods. The emphasis should be on whole, unprocessed
grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and plenty of beans and legumes. Foods labeled as “fat-free” are
generally high in refined carbohydrates and should be eaten sparingly.

Justification for recommendation

Alcohol increases the risk for hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy,
atrial fibrillation and flutter, and strokes. It is attributed in many other
infectious and non-infectious diseases as well.

Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy has been linked with Foetal Alcohol
Syndrome”, which is a combination of physical, behavioural and learning
abnormalities in the new-born child. For mothers who are breastfeeding,

no level of alcohol is safe for their babies.

Heavy drinking during adolescence and young adulthood is associated

with lower neuro-cognitive functioning during the young adult years and
particularly with impairment of attention and visio-spatial skills®”. Early

onset of alcohol use increases the risk of poor health outcomes, poor
academic outcomes, and other problems during adolescence as well as a

risk of developing an alcohol use disorder later on in life. The brain of an
individual develops until the age of 25 years and alcohol use during this period
negatively affects the brain’.

Recent evidence has found that no level of alcohol consumption is safe for
health. Alcohol consumption negatively affects mental and physical health and
is also linked with poorer quality of life and poverty. Even in smaller quantities,
alcohol consumption can increase the risk of breast cancer. It can cause more
severe motor and cognitive dysfunction in women at much lower levels of
consumption than men.

One interesting sidebar to my story involves the effect of caffeine on
my blood pressure. Throughout my weight loss, | continued to drink
small amounts of coffee and tea (despite Dr. McDougall’s warnings
about the former!). | was surprised to find, upon returning to the
doctor’s for testing after my weight loss, that although | was at a
normal weight and all my other numbers had improved, my blood
pressure had not. Since | had been very careful regarding sodium,
consuming no added salt, avoiding processed foods, and reading
labels carefully, | was confused. | spoke with Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn
(author of the book Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease), who told me
about several studies suggesting that while most people are not
significantly affected by caffeine, in sensitive individuals it can
elevate blood pressure for up to 12 hours.

On Dr. Esselstyn’s advice, | went off caffeine in all forms cold turkey,
recording my blood pressure with a home monitor twice a day,
starting 3 days before eliminating caffeine and continuing for 2
weeks after doing so. Within the first caffeine-free day my blood
pressure began to drop, and eventually it edged into the normal
range. It is still mildly elevated at the doctor’s office (“white coat
syndrome”), but at home it stays around 122/70. Interestingly, my
doctor had never suggested eliminating caffeine—she just
automatically put me on medication!

Brown Rice Is No Longer Recommended

Even though brown rice is a whole grain, I no
longer recommend its consumption because
of significant arsenic contamination of most
of the brown rice available for purchase in the
United States—even organic brown rice and
wild rice. Arsenic is a causative factor in many
cancers, and it also promotes heart disease.

The United States is the world’s leading user
of arsenic. Since 1910 about 1.6 million tons
of it have been used for agricultural and in-
dustrial purposes. Lead-arsenate insecticides
were used for many decades, and the residue
still lingers in farm soils today, even though
these pesticides were banned in the 1980s.
Other arsenic-containing ingredients in ani-
mal feed to prevent disease and promote
growth are still permitted. Fertilizer made
from poultry waste can contaminate crops
with arsenic as well.

In the United States as of 2010, about 15
percent of rice acreage was in California, 49
percent in Arkansas, and the remainder in
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas.
That south-central region of the country has a
long history of producing cotton, a crop that
was heavily treated with arsenic pesticides

Diet focus: | tend to eat the same thing daily for about two to four weeks, with a
few indulgences here and there, leading up to competition. Food is fuel, so |
typically focus on getting in as much of a variety of plant-based, whole foods as
possible—the less processed, the better. For me, eating is about being mindful
and intuitive to what the body needs, feels like, and (for some) what the body
looks like. | monitor based on portion or serving size, but when I'm training
someone, | do encourage counting calories and monitoring macros until they get
a feel for and understanding of what works for their bodies. At the very least, |

drink 1 gallon of water everyday, training day or not.

Breakfast: Drink of 1 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, and a dash
of cayenne in 80z of water with 1 cup oatmeal, 1/2 cup raisins, 1 tsp natural
crunchy peanut butter, 1 tsp blackstrap molasses, 1 banana, and 1 serving of

cherries

Lunch: 2 |b pan seared tofu with lots of cayenne and nutritional yeast flakes, 1
baked sweet potato with skin, 2 cups broccoli, 1 cup asparagus, and 1/2 cup

non-dairy ice cream for dessert

Snack: 1 to 20z Beanitos black bean chips, 40z baked tempeh, and salad with
romaine lettuce, sprouts, onion, tomato, cucumber, carrots, 1/2 cup raisins, 1/2

cup sunflower seeds, and lemon juice and apple cider vinegar as dressing

Dinner: 1 bow! of cold whole grain cereal with almond milk (while | prep dinner),

rice, 1 cup asparagus

“In the blood pressure and cholestero! assessment, a theoretical
minimum-risk exposure distribution with a mean of 115 mmHg for
systolic blood pressure and 3.8 mmol/L for total cholesterol
(each with a small standard deviation) were used (Ezzati et al. 2002).
This distribution corresponds to the lowest levels at which the dose-
response relationship has been characterized in meta-analyses of
cohort studies (... [citations] ...). Further, these levels of blood
pressure and cholesterol are consistent with levels seen in
populations which have low levels of cardiovascular disease,
such as the Yanomamo Indians (Carvalho et al. 1989) and rural
populations in China (He et al. 1991a, 1991b), Papua New

LOW CHOLESTEROL POPULATIONS

An alternative source of data relevant to setting a theoretical menimum
comes from examsning mean cholesterol levels im studbes of so-called
“unacculturated” populanons with litth cardiovascular disease and low
cholesterol levels (Poulter and Sever 1994). Unacculturated generally
refers to those populanons that are relatively wolated and have preserved
ther lifestyle over many generations

An overview of typical cholesterol values in men aged 45-64 years in
different populanons noted that while mean cholesterol ranged from $.$
to 7.0mmol/ in many industralized populanons, it was much lower in
hunter-gatherer societies where mean values were as low as 3.0-
3.$mmoll (Law 1999; Law and Wald 1994). Data from individual
stucbes around the world that have focused on these “low cholesterol”
populanons are summarized in Table 7.8. In the Shanghar study, there
was a strongly poutive and apparently independent relanon between
cholesterol concentration and death from [HD, even at these lower levels
(Chen et al. 1991) (Pogure 7.10}

Typocally, the data show thar there is a very low prevalence of car-
diovascular disease in these populations, which exhibit an absence of
obesury due to diets low on salt, cholesterol and fat (partcularty animal
fat), and a lifestyle requiring heavy physical labour (Barnes 1965;
Carvalho et al. 1989; Connor et al. 1978; He et al. 1991a, 19916; Page
et al. 1974; Poulter and Sever 1994; Sever et al. 1980). There is abo
evidence of low blood pressure levels, and no age-related nse in esther
cholesterol or blood pressure levels. Data from these studies indicate
that many of these populations have mean cholesterol levels of about

3.8mmol/ or lower. Therefore, setting a theoretical minimum at 3.8

mmol is justified based on all of the dara.

Modified CAD Risk Calculation tor
Asian Indians (The risk is “Two-fold”
greater)

In order to accommodate the
‘excess risk’, and thus, determine the
CAD risk more adequately among the
Asian indians, one must multiply the 10-
year risk of CAD by a factor of two, when
using American risk prediction
algorahms such the Framingham Risk
Score or European risk
prediction algorithm such
as SCORE (the
Systematic Coronary Risk
Evaluation), except in UK
of other countries, where
specific guidelines for
Asian Indians are alreacy
in place This
recommendation ts based
on the results of
prospective studies that
have shown a 1.4 to 2.2
told risk of dying from CAD
from any combinaton of
traditional risk factors,
diabetes, and metabolic
syndrome among Indians
compared with whites." It is also in
agreement with those of several
international agencies

In the UK and Europe, the calculated 10-

year Framingham risk for CAD 1s
multiplied by a factor of 1 4 for south

Asian males, so that individuals with a
calculated Framingham risk score of
14%, (multiplied by 1.4), will meet the
20% threshold qualifying them for
primary prevention interventions e.g.
lipid-lowering therapy aS opposed to
whites who need to achieve a score of
20%.‘ Accordingly, the summit
recommends no further modifications
for South Asians in Europe. for all
others, the risk should be muluphed by a

following correction factors could be applied when
assessing CVD risk using SCORE among first-generation immigrants
only.

Based on available mortality and prospective data,

e Southern Asia: multiply the risk by 1.4

e Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean: multiply the risk by 1.3
e Western Asia: multiply the risk by 1.2

e Northern Africa: multiply the risk by 0.9

e Eastern Asia or South America: multiply the risk by 0.7

These values reflect the best estimations from available data and
should be interpreted with caution, but can be used to guide CV
risk management.

No single food can protect you against cancer by itself.

But research snows that a diet filled with a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans
and other plant foods helps lower risk for many cancers. In laboratory studies, many individual
minerals, vitamins and phytochemicals demonstrate anti-cancer effects. By including more

foods that fight cancer into your diet, you will help reduce your sk of developing cancer

Being Active
When You Have
Cancer ExeRicise | ammo causes

Do you want to feel better, sleep better and move better? Being active during and after a cancer
diagnosis is an important way to reduce fatigue, increase strength and help ease depression. Regular
physical activity, including aerobic activity and strength training, can help you get through your
treatments and decrease treatment side effects. In addition, stretching can help restore flexibility in
joints that have lost range of motion due to surgery or radiation.

Research supports the following benefits of physical activity for cancer survivors. Being active:

* Helps reduce fatigue, the most common side effect of cancer treatment

* Improves symptoms of depression and anxiety and helps you sleep better

¢ Helps maintain or improve physical function (your ability to get things done in your life)

* Improves your immune system, appetite, muscle strength, range of motion and simply helps your
body and brain work better

* Does not increase your risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema and may help with these symptoms;

* Decreases your risk of cancer coming back.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.

Aerobic Activity

A Aerobic activity increases your heart rate and breathing. Build up to doing at least 150
iM minutes/week of moderate-intensity activity (like walking, light cycling, yoga, tai chi or
water exercise), 75 minutes/week of vigorous activity (like brisk walking, singles tennis or
hiking hills) or a combination of both. You'll improve the way your body stores and uses
energy, as well as your stamina and heart health.

several short sessions may work better than one long one. Be active however you can.

Aerobic Activity Tips and Cautions

Some cancer medications (chemo, etc.) and treatments (surgery and radiation) cause

side effects. Check with your health care provider for specific precautions. For example:

e If you have peripheral neuropathy, take care in walking on treadmills — use handrails.

e If you're at increased risk of infection or irritated skin, avoid swimming pools.

e Avoid exercise if you have an active infection (fever); just after surgery, have extreme
fatigue or difficulty walking

e Some treatments are associated with damage to your heart. Ask your doctor if you've
received any heart-damaging treatment. Get a heart health check prior to starting exercise.

Strength Training

IS Strength training is important for people with cancer because it builds muscle. Muscle
WA tissue plays a big role in balance, fatigue and quality of life. Muscle may also be important
NX to processing chemotherapy drugs. You don't have to be a bodybuilder! Plus, strength

training can make daily activities like lifting laundry baskets or yardwork easier and safer.

What? How often? How hard? How much?

To stay safe and injury free:

Do Carbohydrates Cause Diabetes?

Issues of Concern Go to: &

Carbohydrates are associated with dental caries. Eating large amounts of sugary foods is known to lead to plaque
formation, tooth decay, and cavities. The worst carbohydrate for dental decay is sucrose. On the other hand,
fructose serves as an energy source for oral cavity bactera.[4][5)[6)

Many people falsely believe that that dicts high in carbohydrates lead to the development of type 2 diabetes
when, in fact, the opposite is true. Data show that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is lowered as the amount
of calones from carbohydrates is increased. Diets that are high in carbohydrates tend to increase the sensitivity
of insulin. Thus, today, healthcare providers usually recommend that type 2 diabetics eat a high carbohydrate diet.
An additional benefit of a high carbohydrate diet for type 2 diabetics is that it lowers the risk of heart disease.

Individuals who cat high fiber diets also tend to have low serum cholesterol and high HDL levels than people who
consume a low fiber diet, the lowering of cholesterol also decreases the risk of heart disease. In many parts of
Africa, people who eat high fiber diets tend to have a very low risk of intestinal cancer. But the exact amount of
fiber to eat to prevent colon cancer remains unknown. Anecdotal reports maintain that eating fiber may lower
blood pressure, lower the incidence of gallstones, and decrease blood sugars.

What if there’s enough insulin being
produced, but the insulin doesn’t work (as
in cases of type 2 diabetes)? When insulin
is present, but something is gumming up
the lock to open the cell wall, not allowing it
to work properly, that’s called insulin
resistance. Our cells become resistant to
the effect of insulin.



Text from C:\Users\aiman\Documents\thankful2plants\Articles\Articles\article_1235\image_6.jpg:
This mechanism, by which fat (specifically
saturated fat) induces insulin resistance,
wasn’t known until fancy MRI techniques
were developed to see what was happening
inside people’s muscles as fat was infused
into their bloodstream.



Text from C:\Users\aiman\Documents\thankful2plants\Articles\Articles\article_1235\image_7.jpg:

“Observational studies have also shown that
vegetarian, plant-based (may include some
animal products), and Dietary Approaches to
Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating patterns
are associated with a lower risk of developing
type 2 diabetes (16-19). Evidence suggests
that the overall quality of food consumed (as
measured by the Healthy Eating index,
Alternative Healthy Eating Index, and DASH
score), with an emphasis on whole grains,
legumes, nuts, fruits, and vegetables and
minimal refined and processed foods, is also
associated with a lower risk of type 2
Giabetes (18,20-22)."

A note on DASH Diet: “Prior to developing the DASH Diet,

yi Frank Sacks had demonstrated that a plant-only diet
¢ , reduced blood pressure significantly. Later, when Frank
Sacks was developing a diet based on his findings, he
included animal products so that the diet was
“palatable”!" [p 131 of How Not To Die by Dr Greger]

disease and inflammation. Fish high in these healthy fats

healthy fats along with helping to manage hunger. In

A randomised cross-over
study by the Physicians
Committee of Responsible
Medicine found that a low-fat
plant-based diet can significantly
reduce pain intensity and use of
painkillers in those suffering from
migraine.

Studies have shown that fat
intakes below 30g per day
(about 20% of your daily calorie
intake) will reduce migraine
frequency and intensity.

There is good evidence that a
diet rich in omega 3 fatty acids
reduces migraine frequency, so eat
foods high in omega 3 fats

) e.g. nuts especially walnuts; seeds
like flax, chia and hemp seeds;

green leafy vegetables, or take a
daily supplement of algae-based

omega 3 supplement 250mg. ,

One interesting sidebar to my story involves the effect of caffeine on
my blood pressure. Throughout my weight loss, | continued to drink
small amounts of coffee and tea (despite Dr. McDougall’s warnings
about the former!). | was surprised to find, upon returning to the
doctor’s for testing after my weight loss, that although | was at a
normal weight and all my other numbers had improved, my blood
pressure had not. Since | had been very careful regarding sodium,
consuming no added salt, avoiding processed foods, and reading
labels carefully, | was confused. | spoke with Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn
(author of the book Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease), who told me
about several studies suggesting that while most people are not
significantly affected by caffeine, in sensitive individuals it can
elevate blood pressure for up to 12 hours.

On Dr. Esselstyn’s advice, | went off caffeine in all forms cold turkey,
recording my blood pressure with a home monitor twice a day,
starting 3 days before eliminating caffeine and continuing for 2
weeks after doing so. Within the first caffeine-free day my blood
pressure began to drop, and eventually it edged into the normal
range. It is still mildly elevated at the doctor’s office (“white coat
syndrome”), but at home it stays around 122/70. Interestingly, my
doctor had never suggested eliminating caffeine—she just
automatically put me on medication!

GRAINS.
OF RUTH

Whole Grain Natural Bread Compaty was
created to revive our childhood m«v.ories of
homemade bread fresh from the kitchen oven.
We have a passion for bread, and each loaf is
handcrafted both by human hands and the

ha..as of time.

Our breads symbolize our intimate connection
with the earth, starting with the daily stone
grinding of whole grain-wheat berries into
fresh flour. This timeless'skill preserves all the
nutrients of a living kernel of wheat:

We are proud to bring these heritage loaves
back into your home along with a pleasant '
surprise — what's good for you tastes delicious!

Wholesome Ingredients:

100% Freshly Stone Ground

Whole Wheat Berries, Water,
ney, Yeast, Sea Salk,

: SECOND-HAND TOBACCO SMOKE IN PERSPECTIVE | -

—  --.-- -«

What risks
do you take?

Almost every day. It seems {hat one thing cr
another has been discovered to be some kind
of health risk.

In one scientific study. even drinking ordinary
chior'nated water was linked to cancer.

But as Common sense suggests (and scientists
confirm) not everything described statistically
asa risk is a meaning’u! risk.

For exampie, lots of people have been persuaded
that second-hand tobacco smoke s harmfut.
Not surprising. perhans.

After all. we recognise that smoxing itsetf is a
cisk factor for certain human diseases and

that some people fird second-hand tobacco
smoke unappealing and urpieasant

But what about second-hand tobacco smoxe?
Is it really a meaningful health risk to peopte
who've chosen not to smoke?

Mot, we think, If you lock at the evidence.

The United States Environmental Protection
Agency recently conducted a major review of
studies on the risks of second-hand tobacco
smoke to non-smokers. These studies tyrically
involve non-smokers living with smokers over
along period, such as 20 years.

And this review put the risk of lung cancer
from second-hand tobacco smoke at a level
well below the risk reported by other studies
for many everyday Rems and activities.

And below, tm fact, the risk to heaith that
one other study reported for drinking
chlorinated water.

As the table below shows, many everyday
activities Nave been statistically associated
at cne time or another with apparent
riska to healtn,

But reputable scientists say that weak
associations arent necesaariiy meaningful.

$o there's no dig campeign to persuade you to
Stop drinking chlorinated water.

Nor Is there any sound justification for
@ campalgn against second-hand tobacco
smoke.

If you'd ilke to decide for yourself, piease
write to us at Philip Morris Europe &A.,
c/o P.O. Box 107, 10606 AC Amsterdam, The
Nethertands or fax ue on 06 $1 20 671 96 88.
We'll send you the avidence about second-
hand smoke.

We believe you'll find the case convincing.
